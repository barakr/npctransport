/**
   Create a chain particle hierarchy, to be owned by the model of sd,
   with restraint bonding consecutive particles added to sd, according to the
   parameters specified in fg_data.

   Notes:

   The type of the chain root is specified in fg_data.type(). Individual
   particles may have different types if fg_data.type_suffix_list is non-empty.
   In this case, the type of particle i is suffixed with fg_data.type_suffix_list[i],
   or remains fg_data.type() if the suffix is "".

   The rest length between two consecutive chain beads is
   fg_data.radius() * 2.0 * fg_data.rest_length_factor() and the
   spring constant is the simulation backbone_k parameter.

   If fg_data.is_tamd() is true, created a TAMD hierarchy, otherwise
   a simple parent + beads structure. In the TAMD case, the custom restraint
   are added to sd->get_scoring() and the tamd images are added to sd->root()

   @param[in,out] sd the simulation data whose model is associated with the
                  new chain. The chain is also added to the simulation data
                  scoring object.
   @param parent parent hierarchy to which chain is added
   @param[in] fg_data data about the FG chain
   @param[in] c        color of chain particles
